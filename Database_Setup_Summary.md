## Application Integration

The ProfitIQ application is now properly integrated with your PostgreSQL database. When you:

1. Add a company through the "Add Company" form, it will be stored in the `companies` table
2. Add a college through the "Add College" form, it will be stored in the `colleges` table
3. Add research data through the "Add Research" form, it will be stored in the `research` table
4. Register a new user through the signup form, it will be stored in the `users` table
5. Login with existing credentials, it will authenticate against the `users` table

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Verify PostgreSQL is running on port 5433
2. Check that the database credentials in `DatabaseConnection.java` files are correct
3. Ensure the required tables exist by running `\dt` in psql
4. Check for any error messages in the application console

The database is now fully set up and ready for use with your ProfitIQ application!
